Package Repositories
--------------------
ifdef::wiki[]
:pve-toplevel:
endif::wiki[]

{pve} uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool[APT] as its
package management tool like any other Debian-based system.

{pve} automatically checks for package updates on a daily basis. The `root@pam`
user is notified via email about available updates. From the GUI, the
'Changelog' button can be used to see more details about an selected update.

Repositories in {pve}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Repositories are a collection of software packages, they can be used to install
new software, but are also important to get new updates.

NOTE: You need valid Debian and Proxmox repositories to get the latest
security updates, bug fixes and new features.

APT Repositories are defined in the file `/etc/apt/sources.list` and in `.list`
files placed in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.

Repository Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[thumbnail="screenshot/gui-node-repositories.png"]

Since Proxmox VE 7, you can check the repository state in the web interface.
The node summary panel shows a high level status overview, while the separate
'Repository' panel shows in-depth status and list of all configured
repositories.

Basic repository management, for example, activating or deactivating a
repository, is also supported.

Sources.list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a `sources.list` file, each line defines a package repository. The preferred
source must come first.  Empty lines are ignored. A `#` character anywhere on a
line marks the remainder of that line as a comment. The available packages from
a repository are acquired by running `apt-get update`. Updates can be installed
directly using `apt-get`, or via the GUI (Node -> Updates).

{pve} provides three different package repositories.

[[sysadmin_enterprise_repo]]
{pve} Enterprise Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the recommended repository and available for all {pve} subscription
users. It contains the most stable packages and is suitable for production use.
The `pve-enterprise` repository is enabled by default:

.File `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list`
----
deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/pve bookworm pve-enterprise
----

Please note that you need a valid subscription key to access the
`pve-enterprise` repository. We offer different support levels, which you can
find further details about at {pricing-url}.

NOTE: You can disable this repository by commenting out the above line using a
`#` (at the start of the line). This prevents error messages if your host does
not have a subscription key. Please configure the `pve-no-subscription`
repository in that case.

[[sysadmin_no_subscription_repo]]
{pve} No-Subscription Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, you do not need a subscription key to access
this repository. It can be used for testing and non-production
use. It's not recommended to use this on production servers, as these
packages are not always as heavily tested and validated.

We recommend to configure this repository in `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

.File `/etc/apt/sources.list`
----
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm main contrib
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main contrib

# Proxmox VE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use

[[sysadmin_test_repo]]
{pve} Test Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository contains the latest packages and is primarily used by developers
to test new features. To configure it, add the following line to

WARNING: The `pvetest` repository should (as the name implies) only be used for
testing new features or bug fixes.

Older Ceph Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{pve} 8 doesn't support Ceph Pacific, Ceph Octopus, or even older releases for
hyper-converged setups. For those releases, you need to first upgrade Ceph to a
newer release before upgrading to Proxmox VE 8.

See the respective
https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Category:Ceph_Upgrade[upgrade guide] for details.


[[sysadmin_debian_firmware_repo]]
Debian Firmware Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with Debian Bookworm ({pve} 8) non-free firmware (as defined by
https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines[DFSG]) has been moved to the
newly created Debian repository component `non-free-firmware`.

Enable this repository if you want to set up
xref:sysadmin_firmware_cpu[Early OS Microcode Updates] or need additional
xref:sysadmin_firmware_runtime_files[Runtime Firmware Files] not already
included in the pre-installed package `pve-firmware`.

To be able to install packages from this component, run
`editor /etc/apt/sources.list`, append `non-free-firmware` to the end of each
`.debian.org` repository line and run `apt update`.


[[repos_secure_apt]]

SecureApt
~~~~~~~~~

The 'Release' files in the repositories are signed with GnuPG. APT is using
these signatures to verify that all packages are from a trusted source.

If you install {pve} from an official ISO image, the key for verification is
already installed.

If you install {pve} on top of Debian, download and install
the key with the following commands:

----
 # wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
----

Verify the checksum afterwards with the `sha512sum` CLI tool:

----
# sha512sum /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
7da6fe34168adc6e479327ba517796d4702fa2f8b4f0a9833f5ea6e6b48f6507a6da403a274fe201595edc86a84463d50383d07f64bdde2e3658108db7d6dc87 /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
----

or the `md5sum` CLI tool:

----
# md5sum /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
41558dc019ef90bd0f6067644a51cf5b /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bookworm.gpg
